Pretend you are in an amusement park. You want to ride a roller coaster, however
there is a long line. Instead of waiting you can scan your ticket at a machine
and be added to the queue to get on the ride.

10 people board the ride at once, and after each time people board the ride you
are shown the ticket numbers of the people in the queue in front of you, how long
until you board for your ride, and the number of people in front of you.

When the list is initially built a certain number of random ticket numbers are
pushed onto the queue. After that your ticket is added onto the queue. Next
10 tickets are popped off the queue every time people board until it is your turn to ride.


There aren't any special run instructions. I initially have 86 people pushed onto
the queue but you can change this number if you want.


Good luck!
